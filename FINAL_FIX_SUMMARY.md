# 🎉 ALL ISSUES COMPLETELY RESOLVED!

## Problems You Reported & Solutions

### 1. ❌ **"Can't see any questions after clicking Start Game"**
**Status**: ✅ **FIXED**

**Root Causes Found:**
- Game route was filtering by "mixed" category (doesn't exist)
- "mixed" difficulty was also being filtered (doesn't exist)

**Solution Applied:**
- Modified `backend/routes/game.js` lines 47-53
- Added checks: Skip filter when difficulty/category is "mixed"
- Now "mixed" means "all categories" and "all difficulties"

**Code Changed:**
```javascript
// Before: Filtered even when "mixed"
if (difficulty) {
  filteredQuestions = filteredQuestions.filter(...)
}

// After: Skip filter when "mixed"
if (difficulty && difficulty.toLowerCase() !== 'mixed') {
  filteredQuestions = filteredQuestions.filter(...)
}
```
