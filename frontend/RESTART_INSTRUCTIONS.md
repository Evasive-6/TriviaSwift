# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Restart Required

## The Tailwind CSS configuration has been fixed!

### What was wrong:
- Tailwind CSS v4 plugin was not configured in vite.config.js
- CSS layers were not properly defined in index.css

### What was fixed:
✅ Added `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin to vite.config.js
✅ Updated index.css with proper Tailwind v4 syntax using @layer
